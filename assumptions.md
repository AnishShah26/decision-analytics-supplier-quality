# Modelling Assumptions

- The project does not represent any specific organisation.
- Public and proxy datasets are used to model realistic operational patterns.
- Synthetic data is introduced only to represent process structure and feasibility.
- All assumptions are explicitly documented to prioritise transparency over precision.
- The objective is decision support, not predictive accuracy.
