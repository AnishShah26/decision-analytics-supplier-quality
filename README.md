# Prioritising Operational Interventions: A Decision-Analytics Framework for Supplier Quality Risk

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a structured, decision-driven approach to identifying
which operational process leadership should prioritise for intervention, given
limited time and resources.

The focus is on supplier quality monitoring and qualification within regulated
operations, using analytics as evidence to support strategic decision-making.

## Business Problem
Leadership often faces multiple operational and quality improvement opportunities
but can realistically intervene in only one area at a time.

This project addresses the core question:
**Where should leadership intervene to achieve the maximum reduction in risk and
inefficiency?**

## Decision Framework
Processes are evaluated using five leadership-relevant criteria:
- Risk Severity
- Cost of Inaction
- Detectability of Issues
- Frequency of Issues
- Feasibility of Intervention

Each criterion is weighted to reflect real-world leadership priorities.

## Processes Considered
- Supplier Quality Monitoring & Qualification
- Deviation Handling & CAPA
- Batch Record Review & Product Release
- Change Control & Impact Assessment

## Data Strategy
The analysis uses a transparent mix of:
- Public regulatory and recall data
- Proxy operational quality datasets
- Clearly documented synthetic process-structure assumptions

This mirrors how strategy teams operate when perfect internal data is unavailable.

## Outcome
The framework identifies **Supplier Quality Monitoring & Qualification** as the
highest-priority process for leadership intervention, due to its upstream risk
impact and potential to prevent downstream quality failures.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – Raw, proxy, synthetic, and processed datasets
- `analysis/` – Decision framework and prioritisation analysis
- `docs/` – Final decision report
- `assumptions.md` – Explicit modelling and data assumptions

## Key Takeaway
This project emphasises decision quality over technical complexity and demonstrates
how analytics can be used to guide leadership prioritisation, not just reporting.
